## Enable Kmesh access logging

Kmesh accesslog can be enabled and disabled using kmeshctl.

Please refer to the [kmeshctl Guide](../developer-guide/Kmeshctl-usage/kmeshctl-monitoring.md)


## Detailed TCP Access Logs Generated by Kmesh

Logs are generated by the Kmesh daemon during key stages of a TCP connection's lifecycle:

    - At the time of connection establishment

    - At regular 5-second intervals while the connection is active

    - Upon connection closure

These logs capture critical information about each TCP connection, including source and destination addresses, workloads, namespaces, connection timing, traffic statistics, and connection states.
An example log entry is shown below:


```bash
accesslog: 2025-04-24 08:54:40.971980208 +0000 UTC src.addr=10.244.2.79:41978, src.workload=ws-client, src.namespace=default, dst.addr=10.244.2.78:8080, dst.service=ws-server-service.default.svc.cluster.local, dst.workload=ws-server, dst.namespace=default, start_time=2025-04-24 08:53:50.919245381 +0000 UTC, direction=OUTBOUND, state=BPF_TCP_ESTABLISHED, sent_bytes=3, received_bytes=227, packet_loss=0, retransmissions=0, srtt=40515us, min_rtt=34us, duration=50052.734827ms
